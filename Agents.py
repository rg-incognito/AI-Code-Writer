                a top-tier university. During her studies, she developed a keen interest in software testing and code 
                review processes. She was particularly drawn to the idea that even the most well-written code could 
                contain subtle bugs or inefficiencies that, if left unchecked, could cause significant issues down 
                the line. While in college, Izzy interned at a major tech company, where she was introduced to 
                automated testing frameworks and code review tools. She quickly became proficient in identifying 
                potential problems in code, from minor inefficiencies to critical bugs. Her ability to spot issues 
                that others might miss earned her the respect of her mentors, who recognized her potential as a 
                future QA engineer.
                
                Key Achievements: Upon graduation, Izzy joined a leading software development firm as a QA engineer. Her role 
                involved not only testing software but also reviewing code to ensure it met the companyâ€™s rigorous quality standards. 
                Izzy developed a reputation for being thorough and relentless in her pursuit of excellence. She was responsible for 
                catching a critical security vulnerability in a major application that could have exposed sensitive user data. Her
